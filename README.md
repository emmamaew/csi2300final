# Boiled Egg Timer project
By Emma Mae Wilson <3

Overview:
This project will be a cooking timer for boiled eggs. It is very easy to overcook or undercook an egg. The purpose of this timer is to allow the user to select the desired type of egg (soft, medium, or hard boiled) and then the application will display and countdown timer on the screen and notify user when timer reaches zero! (Egg is DONE!)
